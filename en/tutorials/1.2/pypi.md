# Installing Python Packages

Packages (sometimes called libraries or modules) are re-usable code which you can download, install and then use in your programs. 

There is a huge collection of Python packages which you can use with Mu.

Mu comes with its own package installer which will download the code from the Python Package Index [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) and install it so you can use it in your Mu projects.

Multiple packages can be installed by placing the name of individual packages on new lines e.g. to also install `adventurelib` you would add a 2nd line and click **OK**.

<div class="row">
  <img src="/img/en/tutorials/third_party_packages_install3.png" alt="third party packages window with 2nd package adventurelib entered" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/>
  <br/>
</div>

Packages can be uninstalled by removing the package name from the list and clicking **OK**.

<div class="row">
